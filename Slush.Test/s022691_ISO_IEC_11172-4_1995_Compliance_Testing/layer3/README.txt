This directory contains the Layer-3 compliance bitstreams. This is the
version done on April 26th by Martin Dietz.

NEW: The l3dec (SUN executable) - which was missing in the first 
version - is now available.

There may be further updates to the compliance bitstreams in the future. 

For a detailed description see l3compl.txt

This software is for compliance testing only.

If a software encoder/decoder for Layer-3 is needed, look for the
Layer-3 shareware version.
